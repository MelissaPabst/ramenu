# RAMENU

### Overview
My project will be a web-based ordering app for RAMEN, a Japanese dish with various noodles, types of broths, add-ons, and toppings. Users will be able to create an account, log in, create/edit/delete bowls with a corresponding order, input delivery information, and pay for their order. The user will have the benefit of reading about each ingredient in-depth before deciding to include it. 

I decided to make this project because I have had a hard time ordering ramen; the large laminated menus with items in a foreign language can be confusing, and I often overlook an ingredient I would have wanted to add. I want to be able to provide ease of ordering for someone not familiar with ramen and its intricacies. 

### Features
1. User Sign up: User will be able to create a profile for themselves, delivery address, and favorite orders.
2. User Login: User will be able to login after creating a profile. Passwords will be hashed and salted.
3. CRUD: Users will be able to create an order (but not an ingredient), add ingredients to an order, read an order, update/remove ingredients from an order, and delete an order.
4. View order history: User will be able to view order history.

### Technologies
Java
Spring
MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I have no idea how to structure this in a DB.
React: I'll have to learn how to use this in conjunction with Spring. I found a tutorial.
